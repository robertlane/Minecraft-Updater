Minecraft-Updater
=================

Bash and Python scripts to update Minecraft Server to latest version

Currently this version relys on calling a python script from a shell script.
I am currently using this on my Minecraft servers and have had no issues.
Please note this script is intended to work with the official Minecraft server only.

Requirements:
Python
*nix System
(note: this has not been tested on Mac, but may work with little to no changes.) 

To use:
Download the files and open update.sh. Got to the Variables and change the install path (and/or name) to match your setup. Then you can just run update.sh and the script will take care of the rest.
